# Complexity Analysis

This directory contains code implementations and explanations related to the analysis of time and space complexities of various algorithms.

## Overview

Understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms is crucial for evaluating their efficiency. This section covers:

- **Time Complexity**: Analysis of the execution time of algorithms based on their input size.
- **Space Complexity**: Evaluation of the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run.

## Directory Structure

The directory is divided into two main sections:

### 1. Time Complexity
- **1.Constant-Time.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with constant time complexity.
- **2.Logrithmic-Time.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with logarithmic time complexity.
- **3.Linear-Time.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with linear time complexity.
- **4.Linearithmic-Time.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with linearithmic time complexity.
- **5.Quadratic-Time.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with quadratic time complexity.
- **6.Exponential-Time.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with exponential time complexity.
- **7.Factorial-Time.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with factorial time complexity.

### 2. Space Complexity
- **1.Constant-Space.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms that use constant space.
- **2.Linear-Space.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with linear space complexity.
- **3.Quadratic-Space.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with quadratic space complexity.
- **4.Logrithmic-Space.cpp**: Analysis of algorithms with logarithmic space complexity.
- **5.Recursive-Space.cpp**: Analysis of recursive algorithms and their space complexities.

## Purpose

The goal of this directory is to demonstrate how different algorithms perform with respect to time and space, and to help users understand the theoretical concepts behind Big-O notation, which is used to describe the upper bounds of time and space complexities.

## Usage

Each `.cpp` file demonstrates a specific time or space complexity, with code and comments explaining the analysis. Simply compile and run the C++ code to observe the behavior of the algorithm for different inputs.

For example:
```bash
g++ 1.Constant-Time.cpp -o constant-time
./constant-time
```

This will execute the code in `1.Constant-Time.cpp` and print the results to the terminal.
