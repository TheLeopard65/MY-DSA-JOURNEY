# Leopard's DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Learning Journey**! This repository is a comprehensive collection of my work and understanding as I go through various DSA topics. I created this repo to document and showcase the concepts, implementations, and problem-solving techniques I learn throughout my journey.

### Contents

This repository covers the following important topics in DSA:

1. **Time Complexity**
   Learn about different time complexities like Constant, Logarithmic, Linear, Quadratic, etc., and how they affect algorithm efficiency.

2. **Arrays**
   Basic and advanced operations on arrays, including 1D and 2D arrays and their manipulation.

3. **Strings**
   Working with strings, including common string manipulation algorithms and libraries.

4. **Linked Lists**
   Covers singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, and related operations.

5. **Stacks** 
   Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists. Includes finite and infinite stacks.

6. **Queues** 
   Covers circular queues, linear queues, and priority queues, all implemented using arrays and linked lists.

7. **Vectors** 
   Dynamic and static vector implementations, including multidimensional vectors.

8. **Recursion** 
   Examples of different types of recursion like tail recursion, non-tail recursion, and indirect recursion.

9. **Trees** 
   Binary trees, AVL trees, and Binary Search Trees (BST), along with common operations like traversal and insertion.

10. **Graphs** 
    Graph data structure, along with BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm for directed and undirected graphs.

11. **Hash Maps** 
    Implementation of hash maps using techniques like separate chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

12. **Sorting Algorithms** 
    Implementations of common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.

13. **Dynamic Programming** 
    A deep dive into dynamic programming concepts and examples for solving problems efficiently.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheLeopard65/MY-DSA-JOURNEY.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory you are interested in.

3. Read the `README.md` in each folder for detailed explanations of the concepts and the implementations in each file.

4. Run the individual programs to see the algorithms in action.
